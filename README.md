 Application for Redox - Coding Questions

For the coding task, we'll build a tool to analyze pull request traffic 
for a Github organization.

For the part you do on your own: 
Write some code that will retrieve all pull requests for the Ramda organization 
using the Github web API and store the results in memory. When we pair, we will use 
this collection of pull requests to answer questions like "how many pull requests were 
merged week over week across the organization?" (as a simple example).

Do not use a pre-existing Github library. We want to see you interact directly 
with the Github API. Other than that, use whatever tools (language, frameworks, etc) 
you like, structure your code however you like, etc. We care much more about how you 
solve technical problems generally than any specific knowledge and we want to see you 
at your best.
